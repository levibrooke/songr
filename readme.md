# Lab 11: Spring for Full-Stack Web Apps

Use the Spring Initializr to create a new application with artifact songr with Web (and optionally Devtools) dependency.

We will use this setup for the next 5 labs.

## Running
1. Clone this repo
2. Run the application:
`./gradlew bootRun`
3. Run tests
`./gradlew test`
